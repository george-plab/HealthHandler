# Project Title
Health Component Replicated plugin

![Alt Text - How To setup](/Doc/Slide1_title.JPG)

# Features
This component updates health and it calculates if the player is dead, each me the player 
takes damage. You only need to set up the damage source such as Projec le, damage zone  
or item pickup, and make cast to this component or Character class to get target actor  
damage (or actor to heal). This component does the rest. Furthermore, it is ready for online  
replica on.   
includes a lots of sample in demo.
